# MallForWinter

>**NOTE:** This plugin requires Winter CMS v1.1.2 or below.  
>If your Winter CMS is at least v1.1.3, you don't need this plugin

This plugin adds missing compatibility with the [Offline.Mall](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin) plugin when used with [WinterCMS](https://github.com/wintercms/winter).  

It will update CustomerGroups controller relations definitions to match those of the Winter.User plugin.

## WinterCMS compatibility

This plugin is only revelant for WinterCMS version before `1.1.3`.  
Above versions of WinterCMS natively support aliasing of configuration files.
